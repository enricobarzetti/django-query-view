different data types: groups/lists, text, video, image, file
certain data types will have fields that others won't.  eg. video has directors, actors. text does not have director
django-polymorphic might be useful
provide base class with description, notes, created, updated fields
autocomplete for tags
UI should not allow you to exclude and include the same tag
